# Tic Tac Toe Game - React.js

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using React.js. The game allows two players to compete against each other, taking turns to mark the spaces in a 3x3 grid with either an "X" or an "O". The first player to get three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all nine squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players can click on squares to place their marks.
- **Win Detection:** The game automatically detects when a player has won or if the game ends in a draw.
- **Restart Option:** Players can restart the game at any time.
